> [cite_start]**Note:** This project was built for the **HackX 3.0 Hackathon** [cite: 13][cite_start], solving the FINTECH problem statement: "Al-Powered Invoice and Purchase Order Verification System" [cite: 332] [cite_start]sponsored by **FuturixAI**[cite: 25, 332].

An intelligent financial operations tool that uses AI to automate Purchase Order (PO) and Invoice verification. This app detects discrepancies in seconds, saving time and preventing costly accounting errors.

## üéØ The Problem

Manually verifying financial documents is slow, tedious, and prone to human error. Finance teams must compare Purchase Orders against Invoices line-by-line to check for mismatches in prices or quantities. This can lead to overpayments, duplicate payments, and wasted employee time.

## üí° The Solution

**FuturixAI FinVerify** is a web application that solves this by:
1.  [cite_start]**Extracting Data:** Using the **FuturixAI Shivaay LLM**[cite: 32], our app reads any unstructured document (PDF, image, or text file) and instantly extracts structured JSON data.
2.  **Verifying Documents:** It performs an automated **2-Way Match**, comparing the PO and Invoice JSON data to find any discrepancies.
3.  **Reporting Results:** It instantly provides the user with a clean report showing a "Matched" status or a "Flagged" status with a table of all mismatches.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **ü§ñ AI-Powered Data Extraction:** Leverages the sponsor's **Shivaay LLM** to parse unstructured documents (PDFs, .txt, .png, etc.) into clean JSON, regardless of the document's layout.
* **üìä Automated 2-Way Matching:** Instantly compares the extracted PO and Invoice data to find discrepancies in:
    * Total Amount
    * Vendor Name
    * Line Item Quantities
* **üìã Clear Verification Report:** A user-friendly frontend that displays a "Matched" ‚úÖ or "Flagged" üö© status, along with a detailed table of any mismatches found.
* **üì§ Manual Upload:** A simple drag-and-drop interface for users to upload their PO and Invoice files directly.
* **üìß (Bonus) Gmail Automation:** A "Scan My Gmail" feature that uses the Google API to:
    1.  Securely log in to a user's Gmail account.
    2.  Find emails with PO and Invoice attachments.
    3.  Automatically run the verification process on those attachments.

## üöÄ How to Run This Project Locally

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* A Google Cloud project with the **Gmail API** enabled.
* A `client_secret.json` file from your Google Cloud project.
* An API Key and Base URL from **FuturixAI**.

### 2. Setup

**Step 1: Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/futurixai-finverify.git](https://github.com/your-username/futurixai-finverify.git)
cd futurixai-finverify
```

**Step 2: Install Python dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file. Based on our chat, it should contain:)*
```
Flask
flask-cors
openai
google-api-python-client
google-auth-oauthlib
google-auth-httplib2
```

**Step 3: Add Google API Credentials**
* Download your `client_secret.json` file from the Google Cloud Console.
* Place it in the root of the `HACKX` folder, next to `app.py`.

**Step 4: Set Environment Variables**
This is the most important step. You must set these in your terminal *before* running the app.

*On Windows (Command Prompt):*
```bash
set FUTURIXAI_API_KEY="your-shivaay-api-key"
set FUTURIXAI_API_BASE="httpss://[shivaay.futurixai.com/playground](https://shivaay.futurixai.com/playground)"
```

*On macOS/Linux:*
```bash
export FUTURIXAI_API_KEY="your-shivaay-api-key"
export FUTURIXAI_API_BASE="httpss://[shivaay.futurixai.com/playground](https://shivaay.futurixai.com/playground)"
```

**Step 5: Run the Flask Server**
*Make sure you are running the correct file (e.g., `app.py`).*
```bash
python app.py
```

**Step 6: Open the App**
* Your server is now running. Open your browser and go to:
* **`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`**

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* **3-Way Matching:** Add support for uploading a "Receiving Report" or "Packing Slip" to verify that the items were not only ordered and billed, but also delivered.
* **Results Dashboard:** Create a database to save all verification reports and display a dashboard of common discrepancies, top vendors, and overall accuracy.
* **Full Email Automation:** Create a background worker that scans the Gmail inbox every 10 minutes and sends an email alert when a discrepancy is found.
