# 🧾 AI-Powered Invoice & Purchase Order Verification System

> Automating financial document verification using Artificial Intelligence — built for the MUJ HACKX 3.0 🧠💡

## 🚀 Overview

Manual verification of invoices against purchase orders (POs) is slow, error-prone, and vulnerable to fraud — especially for small and medium enterprises.  
Our project *automates this verification process using AI, ensuring **accuracy, transparency, and efficiency* in financial workflows.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Businesses receive hundreds of invoices and purchase orders daily.  
Checking each document manually for matching fields (like vendor name, total amount, and PO number) wastes time and leads to mistakes.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We built an *AI-driven web platform* that:
- Extracts key fields from uploaded *Invoice* and *Purchase Order (PO)* files using *OCR (Optical Character Recognition)*  
- Compares both documents automatically  
- Highlights any mismatched fields (like amount, date, or vendor)  
- Provides a clean, easy-to-read verification report on the dashboard
